# National Repository Platform Documentation

This is the technical documentation of the National Repository Platform (NRP) built and operated for scientific data in the Czech Republic.

It contains mainly
- [an introduction into what the NRP is](intro-to-nrp/intro-to-nrp),
- [documentation for repository users](end_users/end_users),
- [documentation for repository administrators](repo_admins/repo_admins).

As the NRP is a complex system with services operated by several institutions, extensive parts of documentation are linked from here.

## How to contribute

The documentation is generated from https://github.com/NRP-CZ/documentation. Feel free to fork the repository and create a pull request, especially for more extensive changes. Small corrections would be more conveniently reported by mail to nrp-support@cesnet.cz.
