# Use Cases for the National Repository Platform

Suitable documentation of the National Repository Platform (NRP) depends
heavily on who you and your needs are.

## Repository Users: Accessing the Data

If you just search for data in a repository, you either have a direct link
or a persistent identifier that leads you to the dataset or document in
question directly. Anyway, you are advised to check policies of the
particular repository to fully understand what level of assurance is given
regarding immutability of the data. It always depends on the particular
repository.

Besides the web interface for human users, you can also access the data
through APIs.

If you are searching for a data set and you don't know which repository the
data set rests in, you can start in the [National Metadata
Directory](https://nma.eosc.cz/) (Národní metadatový adresář in Czech,
therefore NMA). The NMA harvests metadata of all repositories in the
platform and also some data repositories elsewhere. It doesn't keep the
data, just the descriptive metadata about the data and links to where the
data is actually stored. The NMA can be thus used as the primary search
interface for scientific datasets in the Czech Republic.


## Repository Users: Data Deposition

For data deposition into a repository, you need to choose a suitable
repository and then to learn how to use it.

### Choice of a Repository

If you are searching for a repository for your data, the choice of a
repository depends heavily on what is customary in your scientific
community. We can therefore give you very general guidelines:
- the first choice should be a well established, community-recognised
  repository,
- if not available, an institutional or the [catch-all repository](https://data.narodni-repozitar.cz) can be used.

FIXME To search for repositories in the NRP, you can use the National Repository
Catalogue/FIXME list of repositories.

### The Catch-all Repository

The [catch-all repository](https://data.narodni-repozitar.cz) is a generic
repository for controlled publishing of scientific data enriched with basic
metadata. The repository supports DOI persistent identifier.

Data deposition is available to registered users, for further instructions,
follow the [user documentation of the catch-all repository](FIXME).

## Establishing a Repository

If you represent a user community or an institution wishing to establish a
repository, there are
- documents on [basic aspects of establishing a repository](https://www.eosc.cz/media/3745435/podminky-vytvareni-novych-a-uprava-stavajicich-repozitaru-v20.pdf) (in Czech, this document covers necessary roles and their responsibilities),
- FIXME documentation for repository administrators for particular
  repository implementations.

Note that the role of repository administrator covers tasks like:
- establishing repository curator and administrator,
- defining metadata profiles and available licenses,
- defining the deposition and data access workflows,
- defining user group roles in the repository,
- instantiating user documentation,
- setting and describing repository policies,
- providing first-level support for the users,
- registering the repository, setting up metadata exports.
Components for all of those tasks are prepared by the infrastructure.
